A wave crawl adventure for
_[Pirate Borg](https://www.limithron.com/pirateborg)_
and [Foundry VTT](https://foundryvtt.com/)
set in [the Dark Caribbean](https://www.limithron.com/darkcaribbean).

* Hundreds of random tables change your fortunes when
  you prowl established trade routes, stay close to land,
  venture out over open waters, explore the Devil’s Triangle
  or the Sargasso Sea, get lost in the Doldrums in summer,
  or dare the ever-growing Abyss.
* Build your legend as a fearsome pirate crew, so the ships
  you prey upon give up as soon as they see your black flag
  with a leveling and reputation system
  [inspired by Mindstorm](https://www.mindstormpress.com/ringing-the-bell)
  and [CGP Grey](https://youtu.be/3YFeE1eDlD0?si=8N4pv6rpoewCfAyt).
* A provisioning system so your quartermaster can fret about
  making sure the crew has enough food, fresh water, and
  grog. Face hard trade-offs about when and where to
  resupply and what costs you might face to do so.
* Use as a campaign framework for your piratical career
  and set any other adventures you care to include on
  the map.
* Rules and random tables for handling storms.
* Tracking high tide and low tide. If you’re on coastal
  waters at low tide, your pilot may need to navigate
  the rocky shoals to avoid running aground!

### Requirements

* _[Pirate Borg](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/pirateborg)_
* [Foundry VTT](https://foundryvtt.com/)
* [Limithron’s Dark Caribbean Map & Cartography Kit](https://www.limithron.com/dark-caribbean-map)
* [Limithron’s Landing Page Kit](https://www.limithron.com/landing-page-kit)

#### Not stricly required but strongly recommended

* [Pirate Borg Premium](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/pirate-borg-premium)
* [Become a patron of Limithron’s at the Admiral tier](https://www.patreon.com/posts/limithrons-table-41712155)
  to get more content modules than we can list here. This module will
  give you lots of random encounters, but Limithron’s modules
  will make it easy to turn those into top-tier VTT experiences
  quickly and easily.

### Roadmap

#### v1.0.0

* The **Dark Caribbean** scene, showing a hex map of the
  region and other information about the status of the
  adventure.
* The **On the Account** macro that lets you designate a
  ship that you’ve added to the map in the **Dark Caribbean**
  scene as the protagonist ship.
* The **Sail** macro, which takes into account the ship’s
  rotation, speed, and barnacle growth to move one hex in
  the right direction, advances the game world time to
  match that speed, and then considers the regions that the
  ship is sailing through to choose which random table to
  roll on — as well as all of the random tables required
  to make that work with enough variation to not get
  repetitive.
* The **Ledger** macro, which brings up the protagonist
  ship’s ledgers, listing the silver, food, fresh water,
  and grog that the ship is carrying, along with estimates
  of when those provisions will run out and options to
  increase or decrease them.
* GM macros to control the chapter, winds, and haunts.

#### v1.1.0

* Add an enmity system for each of the imperial powers.
  The more money you cost any given power (the Spanish, the
  English, the French, or the Dutch), the more they’ll be
  set against you, eventually even dispatching navy ships
  to hunt you down. Spread out your attacks or bribe officials
  to manage the tempers of the Old World’s empires, or
  embrace their ire and prepare for war.

#### v1.2.0

* You’re not the only thing out there roaming the
  Dark Caribbean. This update will be all about adding
  other things moving and operating according to their
  own priorities.
  * **Storms:** They follow _fairly_ predictable patterns,
    but now that they’re things moving across the map you
    can spot them, avoid them, or even use them to your
    advantage.
  * **Hurricanes:** Hurricanes form and intensify as
    hurricane season develops — but the fell powers of
    the Dark Caribbean can make these more than just
    natural storms.
  * **Unique Sea Monsters:** There are several legendary
    beasts roaming the depths of the Dark Caribbean. These
    aren’t just random events, but actual entities on the
    map, so when you encounter the wreckage of a ship
    recently devoured by the Kraken, you know it might not
    be far away. Each beast has its own agenda, but be
    careful: if you cross it, its new agenda could become
    hunting _you_. Our first batch of unique sea monsters
    will include:
    * The Kraken
    * Davy Jones
    * The Leviathan
    * The Black Whale
    * The Mouth of a Thousand Corpses
* Stumble across the path of mayhem and destruction that
  other pirate crews have left in their wake. Will you
  try to avoid them, or will you try to chase them? Each
  NPC crew has its own priorities and activities that it
  will be up to, just like you. Our first batch of other
  pirate crews will include:
  * The _Queen Anne’s Revenge_, captained by Blackbeard
  * The _William_, captained by “Calico Jack” Rackham
  * The _Royal Fortune_, captained by “Black Bart” Roberts.
  * The _Ranger_, captained by Benjamin Hornigold
  * The _Katherine_, captained by Charles Vane
  * The _Whydah Gally_, captained by “Black Sam” Bellamy
* GM can select which sea monsters and pirates are
  included. If you activate the optional setting for a
  more historically-grounded game, pirates that were dead
  or retired by your game’s start date are excluded, and
  others will only join the game when the game date reaches
  the point where they went on the account. Of course, what
  happens from that point on is up to you to play to find out!
* Beyond this, future releases will probably be tweaking
  random tables, fixing bugs, and adding new sea monsters or
  pirate crews.
